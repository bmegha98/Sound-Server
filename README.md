# TCP-Client-Server-Application
 Implement a TCP client- server application to implement a service that returns the sounds made by animals. The name of each requested animal will be specified by a client . The server will start in passive mode listening on a specified port for a transmission from a client. Separately, the client will be started and will contact the server on a given IP address and port number that must be entered via the command line.
